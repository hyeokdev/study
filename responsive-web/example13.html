                Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other<br/> 
                monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core<br/>
                library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or<br/>
                existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-<br/>
                Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.
